# 0.13.14 (2018-01-25)

Fixes:

* Fix memory leak caused by Rack::Session::Pool

Changes:

* Rack::Session::Pool and Rack::Protection are not enabled as default now.

Please note that Rack::Protection is not enabled as default now.
To protect your geminabox from XSS and CSRF vulnerability,
you have to embed Rack::Protection by yourself in your `config.ru` file as:

```ruby
require "geminabox"

Geminabox.data = "/var/geminabox-data" # ... or wherever

# Use Rack::Protection to prevent XSS and CSRF vulnerability if your geminabox server is open public.
# Rack::Protection requires a session middleware, choose your favorite one such as Rack::Session::Memcache.
# This example uses Rack::Session::Pool for simplicity, but please note that:
# 1) Rack::Session::Pool is not available for multiprocess servers such as unicorn
# 2) Rack::Session::Pool causes memory leak (it does not expire stored `@pool` hash)
use Rack::Session::Pool, expire_after: 1000 # sec
use Rack::Protection

run Geminabox::Server
```
